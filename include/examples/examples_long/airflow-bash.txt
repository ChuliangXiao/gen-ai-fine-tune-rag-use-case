## Airflow Bash

Did you know you can create bash statements with Python logic in Airflow? Brand new in Airflow 2.9: the @task.bash decorator!

```python
from airflow.decorators import task

@task.bash(env={"MY_VAR": "Hello World"})
def bash_task():
    return "echo $MY_VAR"  # the returned string is executed as a bash command

bash_task()
```
